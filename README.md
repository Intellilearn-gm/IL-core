## Project Overview

IntelliLearn is a gamified educational platform designed to make learning Web3, blockchain, and decentralized identity intuitive, engaging, and rewarding. Instead of static tutorials or boring videos, users learn by doing—through games that simulate real-world blockchain logic. Each game integrates with OCID (Open Campus ID), enabling decentralized login, progress tracking, and credentialing. As players progress, they earn dynamic NFTs that evolve based on achievements, creating a verifiable proof of learning on-chain.

## Why IntelliLearn?
- **Gamified Learning:** Increases retention, engagement, and curiosity.
- **Web3 Concepts Made Visual:** Abstract ideas become interactive and practical.
- **On-Chain Credentials:** Earn dynamic NFTs as proof-of-learning, enabling future academic or professional integrations.
- **OCID Integration:** Seamless, user-owned identity aligns with the ethos of decentralized education.

IntelliLearn is the future of Web3 education. Instead of lectures, users play. Instead of forms, they connect with OCID. Instead of centralized credentials, they earn dynamic, on-chain proof of learning. In a world moving toward decentralized knowledge systems, IntelliLearn makes blockchain education fun, accessible, verifiable, and engaging—for students, devs, and curious minds alike.

## Games on IntelliLearn

### 1. Blockchain Basics Stickman (Archery Game)
- **Location:** `src/games/ArcheryGame/`
- **Description:** Learn the fundamentals of blockchain while adjusting angle and power to shoot arrows at enemy targets. Each level comes with a blockchain-related quiz, ensuring learning through action.

### 2. Web3 Miner Challenge (Block Miner Game)
- **Location:** `src/games/BlockMinerGame/`
- **Description:** Move a bucket to collect falling coins. Each coin reveals a fact about Web3, Educhain, or blockchain. Fast-paced, arcade-style game to retain attention and reinforce core ideas.

### 3. OpenCampus Code Quest
- **Location:** `src/games/OpenCampusCodeQuest/`
- **Description:** Navigate a spaceship and collect tokens. Learn how OCID works and why decentralized identity matters. Players avoid obstacles while unlocking OCID-based concepts.

### 4. DAO Dungeon Escape
- **Location:** `src/games/DAODungeonGame/`
- **Description:** Traverse a dungeon map, collecting tokens to unlock a door. Demonstrates how DAOs function, simulating access control, participation, and rewards. Can be extended with smart contract-based puzzles or wallet-based access control.
